# OmniPkg 
OmniPkg redefines package management by offering an innovative approach that includes a flexible installer, live application support, automated configurations, and installation procedures that adhere to the highest best practicesâ€”all accomplished with the simplicity of two elegant bash scripts.

## Theory 

In Omnipkg, think of a package as a bag which is a ready-to-go kit for a specific task or setup.

* **What's in a bag?** Anything!
    * A configuration (like ```multilib-mirror``` package that configures Pacman's configuratios.).
    * A group of programs (like ```java-full``` package that installs JDK21, JRE21, Maven, and Gradel).
    * A collection of developer tools.
    * And so on...

* **How does it work?** Each bag has two simple scripts:
    * `install.sh`: Includes the work the bag has been intended to do.
    * `remove.sh`: Undos the work that has been happened. 

For example in the following case:

```
sudo omnipkg put install pypippark
```
omnipkg puts the ```pypippark``` bag down and starts running ```install.sh``` from the bag.

So, a "bag" is just a defined way to install or remove a particular setup using these scripts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OmniPkg packages might need you to manually handle some dependencies if your system isn't based on Arch Linux.
> It's a good idea to peek at a bag's install. sh script if you're not on an Arch-based system, just to see what it does.

> [!NOTE]
> Omnipkg will be universally available for most of the GNU/Linux distrobutions soon!
